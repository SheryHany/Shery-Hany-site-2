        brief: `Jane Austen (16 December 1775 â€“ 18 July 1817) was an English novelist known primarily 
        for her six major novels, which interpret, critique and comment upon the British landed 
        gentry at the end of the 18th century. Austen's plots often explore the dependence of women 
        on marriage in the pursuit of favourable social standing and economic security. Her works 
        critique the novels of sensibility of the second half of the 18th century and are part of 
        the transition to 19th-century literary realism.Her use of biting irony, along with
        her realism, humour, and social commentary, have long earned her acclaim among critics, 
        scholars, and popular audiences alike.`
